  <p id="def">The banker’s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an “s-state” check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.
    <br/>
    Banker’s algorithm is named so because it is used in banking system to check whether loan can be sanctioned to a person or not. Suppose there are n number of account holders in a bank and the total sum of their money is S. If a person applies for a loan then the bank first subtracts the loan amount from the total money that bank has and if the remaining amount is greater than S then only the loan is sanctioned. It is done because if all the account holders comes to withdraw their money then the bank can easily do it.
    <br/>
    In other words, the bank would never allocate its money in such a way that it can no longer satisfy the needs of all its customers. The bank would try to be in safe state always.

                  <h4>Analysis of Banker's Algorithm approach</h4>
                  <p>
                    Characteristics of Banker's Algorithm<br/>

                    1. Keep many resources that satisfy the requirement of at least one client<br/>
                    2. Whenever a process gets all its resources, it needs to return them in a restricted period.<br/>
                    3. When a process requests a resource, it needs to wait<br/>
                    4. The system has a limited number of resources<br/>
                    5. Advance feature for max resource allocation<br/><br/>
                    Disadvantage of Banker's algorithm<br/>

                    1. Does not allow the process to change its Maximum need while processing<br/>
                    2. It allows all requests to be granted in restricted time, but one year is a fixed period for that.<br/>
                    3. All processes must know and state their maximum resource needs in advance.<br/><br/>
                    Summary:<br/>
                    1. Banker's algorithm is used majorly in the banking system to avoid deadlock. It helps you to identify whether a loan will be given or not.<br/>
                    2. Notations used in banker's algorithms are 1) Available 2) Max 3) Allocation 4) Need<br/>
                    3. Resource request algorithm enables you to represent the system behavior when a specific process makes a resource request.<br/>
                    4. Banker's algorithm keeps many resources that satisfy the requirement of at least one client<br/>
                    5. The biggest drawback of banker's algorithm this that it does not allow the process to change its Maximum need while processing.<br/>
